## 🎮 What is Conway’s Game of Life?

Conway’s Game of Life is a zero-player game invented by mathematician **John Conway**. It simulates how patterns evolve based on just **four simple rules** — no user input is needed once it begins.

> The result? Beautiful, chaotic, and often *lifelike* animations.
